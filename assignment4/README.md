# Assignment: Build Your Own Image

- Dockerfiles are part process workflow and part art
- Take existing Node.js app and Dockerize it
- Make `Dockerfile`. Build it. Test it. Push it. (rm it). Run it.
- Expect this to be iterative. Rarely do I get it right the first time.
- Details in `dockerfile-assignment-1/Dockerfile`
- Use the Alpine version of the official '`node`' 6.x image
- Expected reuslt is web site at http://localhost
- Tag and push to your Docker Hub account (free)
- Remove your image from local cache, run again from Hub.
